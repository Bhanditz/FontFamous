The idea is that it is a pain in the butt to find high quality logos to show off your press mentions. You have to dig through Google Images and then spin out in Photoshop. 

Font Famous solves this problem by allowing you to simply include our CSS stylesheet and adding a class to any element you want to transform it into a scalable vector media logo. 

You can style these logos with CSS like you would any icon or font.
